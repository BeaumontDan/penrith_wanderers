### Description

This is a CSS Style training/learning project, set by [Codecademy][codecademy], untilising CSS Flex-box and Grid.

I chose 'Penrith Wanderers' as my club; as I'm based our of Penrith, Cumbria, UK and I am a keen hiker and rambler myself. I also feel that the local Ramblers website is lacking in a few areas. By designing and building my own page for local hikers, I was able to harness some of my new skills alongside my expirience as a graphic designer to create an theoretical replacement for this site and also publish some of my own photgraphy to the page.

### Codecademy Objective

##### Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

##### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!
